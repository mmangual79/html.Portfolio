    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Milton Mangual, I am a proud veteran of the United States Air Force. <br>  That experience has allowed me to help others while in different job occupations. <br>  For the last two years, I have worked in the Environmental Health & Safety field. <br> Taking care of people takes a toll on a person so I am looking to change fields.
    </p>

<p>Since a kid I have always considered myself creative. <br>  Never thinking having an imagination would make me an income, I always disregarded that part of me.  <br>  A good friend recommended to me to become a coder.  <br>  Today I am using my spare time to learn to become a webpage developer.   <br>  Another goal of mine, is to start a YouTube channel on horror movie reviews.  <br> I do want to monetize not for the money but to really show people I can understand a good horror movie when I see one.</p>
